<p>  Hello campers and soon to be campers, we are excited that you have exspressed your interest to the ARCTIC. You are currently
    on our home page and before you go any further allow us to take the time to tell you about ourselves. We are company based in the Arctic 
    an the nearest country to us would be Russia. The idea camping to me was always placed in the woods from Tennessee all the way to Switzerland but
    never the Arctic so thats when I got the idea. Lets bring camping to the coldest place on earth and lets make it an unforgettable experience
    for anyone that comes here.
