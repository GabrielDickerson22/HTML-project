    <h1><em>About the ARCTIC</em></h1>
    <!--First-->
    <p> Hello my name is Gabriel Dickerson and I am founder of The ARCTIC. Before I made this company I was never a fan of
        hunting or camping, honestly iv'e always been an indoors type of person. Giving people the chance to see something new in life is why 
        I created this company.So why not make that experience cold I thought for vacation everyone liked to travel to hot place Florida, California
        Mexico etc. So thats why this attraction is  cold so everyone can see this side of the world.
    </p>
    <!--Second-->
    <p>
        It's not just the cold you will experience here but also the wild life. If you traveled by boat you probably seen the huge Orcas that live
        here if not no worrys you can see them in an under water experience. While here you most definitely go home with a new slogan ("BEWARE OF THE POLAR BEAR").
        If animals are not your thing come and climb are ice mountains with are trained explorers. That and much more awaits you here at The ARCTIC.
    </p>
    <!--Third-->
    <p>
        You have heard from me now I wwould like to hear from you please go over to our contact page to give us a call and see what price 
        fits you. Also on that page you will see an emergency contact number right that down if you plan to visit. If you still need time to decide go
        on over to our Arc Fam page to see what others think about ones experience and remember not everyone experienced the same feeling. We would thankyou 
        if you could the word about this company since it is new. Thankyou and once again BEWARE OF THE POLAR BEARS!
